Fquirrel - a server-side jquery-tmpl in F#

As part of an ongoing project at Huddle, I'm investigating whether we can generate HTML on the server side from JQuery templates.
Obviously, that's fraught with danger since jquery-tmpl allows you to have arbitrary javascript in expressions, but this is a toy library to see how far I can get.

This is in no way intended to be performant, error-free, or usable. It's just a way for me to mess about with F#

Any and all code in here is public domain as per http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

This library is dependent on NUnit, FSUnit, and FParsec, all of which are separately licensed and warranted
